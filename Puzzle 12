Pizza

At a restaurant, pizzas can be ordered in boxes of 6, 9, and 20. What is the largest number of Pizzas that cannot be ordered using any combination of these boxes?

For Example:
There exist two types of solutions for such a problem.
They include mathematical and algorithmic ones.
The mathematical solution is limited only to the given box values, while the algorithmic solution can be applied to any box values.
Mathematical Solution:

The combination of 6 and 9 will give you all the multiples of 3 (except 3 pizzas).

If a number is not a multiple of 3, then use one box of 20. Calculate the remaining value and check if it is a multiple of 3. For example:

Therefore, it is possible to buy 35 pizza boxes.
But it is not possible to buy 28 boxes because after using one box of 20 only 8 boxes are left which is not the multiple of 3.
Similarly, after using 1 box of 20, if the remaining number is not divisible by 3, then check if another box of 20 can be used.
For example:
Repeatedly subtract 20 from a given number until get a number divisible by 3.
This approach always works, because any number when divided by 3 gives a remainder of 0, 1 or 2.
For example, 15 is divisible by 3, so get a remainder of 0 on dividing 15 by 3.
Now, if take any number which is not a multiple of 3 and add it to 15 repeatedly and divide the addition result by 3.
The remainder will be taken as an output sequence as 0, 1, 2 0, 1, 2 01, 2 or 0, 2, 1 0, 2, 1 0, 2, 1.
From the above approach, it looks like any number of pizzas>= 40 can be bought but there is 1 number above 20 which cannot be achieved by any combination of 20, 9, and 6.
After using a maximum of 2 boxes of 20, the remaining value must be divisible by 3. As seen above, number 3 cannot be achieved by any combination of 20, 9, and 6.
The highest number of pizzas that can't be bought= 20+ 20+ 3= 43.
Algorithm:

The smallest box is 6.
If achieve 6 consecutive numbers, then get all further numbers by simply adding one more box of 6.
For example:
So the target is to found those 6 consecutive numbers.
Let's make combinations to achieve a number of pizza boxes in increasing order.
On observing the pattern 6 consecutive numbers will be taken from 44 to 49.
Therefore, it can be achieved any number of boxes greater than 49 with the help of one more box of 6.
So, the highest number of boxes that cannot be obtained by any combination of 20, 9, and 6 are present before 44 i.e. 43. This is the required answer.
