A Man with Medical Condition and 2 Pills

A man has a medical condition that requires him to take two kinds of pills, call them A and B.

The man must take exactly one A pill and exactly one B pill each day, or he will die.
The pills are taken by first dissolving them in water. 
The man has a jar of A pills and a jar of B pills.
One day, as he is about to take his pills, he takes out one A pill from the A jar and puts it in a glass of water. Then he accidentally takes out two B pills from the B jar and puts them in the water. Now, he is in the situation of having a glass of water with three dissolved pills, one A pill and two B pills.

Unfortunately, the pills are very expensive, so the thought of throwing out the water with the 3 pills and starting over is out of the question. How should the man proceed in order to get the right quantity of A and B while not wasting any pills? 

Solution: Follow this step-wise approach to help the man take his medicine in the correct way.  

Step 1: Add one more A pill to the glass and let it dissolve.
Step 2: Take half of the water today and half tomorrow.
It works under the following assumptions.  

The dissolved Pills can be used the next day.
The man has to take pills at least for one more day.
The pills are uniformly dissolved in water
Alternate Solution:

The person should add pill A to the glass of water.
Now, the person can boil the solution in a jar and the water will get evaporated. Thus, the residue of the medicine will be left.
Now he can take half of the residue, which will be equivalent to a single day dosage (1 Pill A + 1 Pill B) and take the rest tomorrow.
It works under the following assumptions:

The medicine does not evaporate with the water.
